# warmingStripesFriendshipBracelets
Jupyter Notebook to generate warming stripes bracelet instructions for any country or U.S. state average observed temperature trend.

This notebook generates the instructions. Just put in the country or state code of your choosing. You can change the number of discrete colors, but I find that 7 is a good number for doing friendship bracelets. 

You'll need to get the observed temperature anomaly data file for gistemp or similar.
